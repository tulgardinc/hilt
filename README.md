Hilt is a simple immidiate mode text editor written in zig.
It uses Sokol (an abstraction over most graphics API) to draw the UI.

It is not currently usable.

I basically use this project to mess around with graphics programming and text rendering.

Uses zig 0.14.1

```
git clone https://github.com/tulgardinc/hilt.git
cd hilt
zig build run
```
